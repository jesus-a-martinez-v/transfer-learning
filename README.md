## Getting started

First, you'll need `conda`. Then, create the environment with the following command:

```
conda create -n cnns-in-depth python=3.6
```

Activate the environment:

```
source activate cnns-in-depth
```

Finally, install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Interact with the notebooks

Once in the conda environment, run:

```
jupyter notebook
```
